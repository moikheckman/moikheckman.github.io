            <h1 class="title">A Mid-January Update</h1>
            <h3 class="published">January 18th, 2022</h3>
            <p>I've put it out on social media already, but I am absolutely shocked by the amount of interest in <em>The Steam War</em> that people have had. As of last weekend, you all have ordered at least thirty copies of the book in its varying formats. I'll stop doing counting unless the book hits 100, but that seems to be a far way off still.</p>
            <br />
            <p>As a couple of you have already noticed (or noticed when clicking on this blog post), the website has been going through multiple stages of renovation, too. This is part of my effort to look more professional and to use the website as my portfolio, rather than just for <em>The Steam War</em>. That said, I won't generally do a blog post for anything not book related, and <a rel="noopener" class="underline" href="https://thesteamwar.com">https://thesteamwar.com</a> still exists - sort of. The link now redirects you to <a rel="noopener" class="underline" href="https://msheckman.com/the-steam-war">https://msheckman.com/the-steam-war</a> and always will, so if you're only here to see things about <em>The Steam War</em>, you can still use the old link. I don't blame you. I'd do it too.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'll talk about the new sections of the website here shortly, but I wanted to highlight things that are coming soon, because I'm excited.</p>
            <br />
            <p>First is <em>The Steam War</em>'s sequel, <em>The Brass Dove</em>. This is another story that I've just been sitting on for years and am now finally working on it again, and it's coming along quite well. I'm excited to finish <em>The Brass Dove</em> and to finally release it to the world as well. The most likely plan is to release it by the end of this calendar year, but there will of course be updates if that changes. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Second is <em>Orion and the Clockwork</em>. I can't say much about this project yet, but I'd love to have it released halfway through next year (2023). Like the other two, it's a concept I've sat on for a while, but the actual drafting of the story only started this past weekend. It's got a long way to go before it's ready to be revealed.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Last, I have an unnamed sister project to <em>TSW</em> and <em>OATC</em> books. I can't say too much about it, yet, but know that this one will probably be showing up soon somewhere on the website. It has a concept that I'm super excited for.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Now, here's the rest of the website mumbo-jumbo: the new home page features ways to visit all the tabs of the website. You can see what each new tab is, although most of them are under construction still. I know you were all very excited to see my resume, but it'll have to wait. I'm sorry.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Thanks to everyone for a fantastic book launch! Most that were ordered through me are still being processed or are currently being shipped, and I'll have them out as soon as I can!</p>
            <br />
            <p>- Michael</p>
