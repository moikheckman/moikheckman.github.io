            <h1 class="title">A January Double Feature</h1>
            <h3 class="published">December 31st, 2022</h3>
            <p>This first year of releasing books has been eventful, to say the least. On December 31st of 2021, I published <em>The Steam War</em> on Amazon. The outpouring of support I got for the book was a lot more than I expected, to say the least. My debut self-published novel achieved nearly fifty copies sold! While on the scale of a lot of published authors that number is small, it is still incredibly significant in my eyes and has motivated me to continue.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Not too long after, I started working on the story of Luna in <em>Luna on the Run</em>. I had as much fun writing this as I had <em>The Steam War</em> years ago. We hit some milestones along the way for that as well, with almost two thousand views across all platforms and a Watty shortlist nomination, as well as the title of <a rel="noopener" class="underline" href="../an-antihero-interview/" target="_blank">"Badass Author of the Month"</a>. I am astounded by the support both stories received, and forever grateful.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>To top off the year, we met Tes Simms in <em>The Ghost of the Hindenburg</em>, a short(ish) horror story set in the same universe as the previous two books. The last chapter released December 23, in preparation for <em>The Brass Dove</em>'s original release date of December 31st, 2022. Today.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>So, where is it?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Unfortunately, this has been a busy year for me on top of all of the stories I've been working on. A new job, a new apartment, school (which I've now completed), and everything else that happens in life. Not to mention the biggest obstacle of all: depression. Add to this the fact that <em>Luna</em> was nominated and threw off my whole schedule, and it's safe to say there's no releasing <em>The Brass Dove</em> today.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>January 31st, however, is a different story.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In fact, January 31st is <em>two</em> different stories.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In exactly one month, we will see two new projects: The aforementioned <em>Brass Dove</em>, which takes place immediately following the events of <em>The Steam War</em>, and <em>The Blood Moon Pirate</em>. <em>The Blood Moon Pirate</em> is a short-story sequel to <em>Luna</em>, and will feature a chapter release every month for ten months starting in January. What is it about? We'll just have to wait and see for a little bit longer.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Shortly after that, in February, starts the sequel to <em>The Ghost of the Hindenburg</em>: <em>The Ruins of Alpha Centauri</em>. I won't say much about it, but just know it's coming soon. </p>
            <br/>
            <p>The next big novel-sized release will be <em>Orion and the Clockwork</em>, which will follow the story of the titular characters in the city of Carmsborough. My aim is to have that release (or start releasing) in June and finish by/near the end of the year. There will, of course, be more about this when the time comes.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>And that's all I can say for now! There's a lot planned for the year, and I hope to see all of you through it! Have a wonderful new year!</p>
