            <br/>
            <br/><br/><br/>
            <p>By the light of God, my love, you are betraying me!            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	You betrayed our marriage long before I betrayed you.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Let’s not pretend you were innocent in what was happening.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Every day I prayed you would stop, and yet, you continued.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>And to cheat on me! Your loving husband! With someone like him!            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Some twisted version of love you have.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Says the one who is chasing the… the shoeshiner! A direct front to our sanctity!            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	That’s not fair, and you know it. He is a good man.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Please.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Ever since you decided to go after that vein of “diasidese,” you’ve been–            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>How dare you question my work! My life’s goal!            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Recent events have led me to drift away. And I can’t pretend that–            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Enough. You’ll be hanged for your adultery, Caroline.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Don’t think you will come out on top from this. I am the important one.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Maybe you should have thought about your reputation before cheating on me, then.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>	Alright. Since you refuse to see reason, perhaps you should just leave.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Yes, maybe I should. I will see you in court, Caroline.            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>Yes, you shall. Now leave my house.</p>
