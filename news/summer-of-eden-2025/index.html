            <h3 class="published">Golem_Leader - July 3rd, 2025</h3>
            <p>Hello, Edenites! It's been a while!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>As I'm sure it's been made well aware of at this point, the server had a corruption issue brought forth by the previous host switching things around in the backend without warning. As such, there have been some significant changes: </p>
            <p id="indent">- The Survival world is essentially gone. We've created a new one to fill that gap.</p>
            <p id="indent">- Airships, in turn, are also gone. If you are Sky Pilot or above, contact a staff member, and we'll get you a replacement.</p>
            <p id="indent">- Inventories (should be) correct, but some may experience losses as well.</p>
            <p id="indent">- Ranks may be incorrect.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>What does this all mean?</p>
            <br/>
            <p>First of all, we know this can be demotivating. In fact, we've spent a collective of 100+ hours trying to get everything back to a workable state on <em>our side</em>, as we lost a lot, too. That said, we have plans in place to get everyone back into the swing of things, if not in a perfect way.</p>
            <p id="indent">1. You can now do /rewards revival to receive a Creative World Port coupon, which you can use to rebuild your house and have a staff member port it over. There's no time limit on redeeming this, so even if you decide you want to rebuild your house in survival, you can have something else ported. Also included are some other items to help kickstart your return to Eden.</p>
            <p id="indent">2. All users will have temporary access to the Creative world to assist with this process.</p>
            <p id="indent">3. A new Bubble Halo trail will be added as consolation.</p>
            <p id="indent">4. We will be having a drop party (with a lot more goodies than usual) on a weekend after launch. This will likely include some runes (remember, if you get a rune coupon, you can use /runeitem while holding a runeable item in your hand.)</p>
            <p id="indent">5. Any users who lost items or rank, let a staff member know, and we will provide as needed. For any who lost VIP ranks/perks, proof will need to be provided.</p>
            <p id="indent">6. A new event!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Would it really be a Sky Eden return without an event to come with it? I say no. Therefore, we have a new event underway...</p>
            <br/>
            <p><b>Summer of Eden 2025: Heist!</b></p>
            <br/>
            <p>Many older Edenites may remember the spawn ship, a large ship floating over the center of the world. For a while, it was stationed above Bracketburgh as well, but left to be decommissioned. Now, with a new captain and mayor, the ship has returned!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>There's just one problem: Mayor Del, in anticipation of the reopening of the <em>Globetrotter</em> on her new maiden voyage, has discovered that the ceremonial scissors for cutting the ceremonial rope have been unceremoniously stolen. She needs you to help her find the scissors. What's in it for you? Rune coupons and a new custom weapon, of course!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Heist event, as well as the reopening of the server, will begin on <b>July 20th, 2025</b>. The drop party will likely occur the weekend after that, unless there's a large enough amount of staff available the weekend of. From there, we have plenty more planned to wrap up the summer, so stay tuned and reimmerse yourself in the world of Sky Eden!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I look forward to seeing you here!</p>
