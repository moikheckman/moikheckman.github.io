            <h1 class="title">Sky Eden's Return</h1>
            <h3 class="published">Golem_Leader - June 1st, 2023</h3>
            <p>That's right. It wasn't an April Fools joke.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We've brought Sky Eden back, new and improved (again)! You've probably noticed the changes and activity in the discord channel, as well as GolemBot coming back from the dead. We're hear to confirm the greatest news of 2023 (aside from my wedding): Sky Eden is here to stay!</p>
            <br/>
            <p>How? Why? What? Well, let's talk about it.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The server had been dying for a while. The simple fact of the matter is that nobody can spend as much time as they used to playing, and I couldn't justify paying for the server anymore, especially with no job or a weak-paying one.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We also couldn't commit time to things we promised, the End Dungeon as our biggest example.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But not again. We're here, and we have everything we've promised.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p><b>WHAT'S NEW:</b></p>
            <br/>
            <p>Aqua Eden Part 2 has arrived. Dive back into Aqua Eden and make a splash with all the minigames, new lore, bigger stories, more rewarding exploration, as well as a significant lack of Solarum.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The End Dungeon is here. Yeah, that's right. Fight those mobs. Make it to the boss. Die a few times. Go find it on the map, but we're not telling you how.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The Hive is back as well. The first and favorite dungeon has returned, back to its bee-filled glory. Find the hive marked on the livemap.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Oh yeah, the livemap. Never worry about trying to remember the link for the livemap again, because now it's <a href="https://livemap.skyeden.org" class="underline">livemap.skyeden.org</a> (or skyeden.org/livemap).</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Speaking of, the new website. Everything compiled in a sleek, custom, quick website. Find information about everything you need for Sky Eden, with more information on the way as we can.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A new server IP. Yeah, just like the livemap, no more remembering the whole ugly string. Now it's just <b>play.skyeden.org</b>. Welcome to the future.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A new physical server. There's likely to be kinks to work out, but I actually physically own this new server, meaning it's all up to us. RAM, storage, speed. Donating helps to pay my electric bill (and maybe increase server strength in the future), but we will no longer RELY on donating.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>And all of this on Sky Eden's 12th birthday. That's right, happy birthday to everyone's favorite steampunk survival server. (Oh, and you too, Link).</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>What would you like to see introduced/reintroduced to Sky Eden? Now's the perfect time to really make this server what we've always wanted it to be. Looking forward to seeing all of you again!</p>
            <br/>
